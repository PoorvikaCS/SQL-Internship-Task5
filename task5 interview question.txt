Difference between INNER and LEFT JOIN:

INNER JOIN returns only the rows with matching values in both tables.

LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right; unmatched right-side values appear as NULL.

What is a FULL OUTER JOIN?

It returns all rows from both tables.

Rows with no match in the other table have NULL values in place.

Not supported directly in SQLite but can be simulated using LEFT JOIN UNION RIGHT JOIN.

Can joins be nested?

Yes. Joins can be nested using parentheses or written as multiple joins in sequence.
Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM A  
JOIN (B JOIN C ON B.id = C.bid) ON A.id = B.aid;
How to join more than 2 tables?

By chaining multiple JOINs.
Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT *  
FROM A  
JOIN B ON A.id = B.aid  
JOIN C ON B.bid = C.bid;
What is a cross join?

Also called a Cartesian product.

Combines every row of one table with every row of another.

Example: 4 rows Ã— 3 rows = 12 results.

What is a natural join?

A JOIN that automatically matches columns with the same name and data type in both tables.

Not recommended in complex databases as it can lead to unexpected results if column names clash.

Can you join tables without foreign key?

Yes. You can join any tables using JOIN ON or WHERE, even without foreign keys.

Foreign keys are for data integrity, not required for querying.

What is a self-join?

A table joined with itself.

Used to compare rows within the same table.

Example: An employee table showing manager relationships.

What causes Cartesian product?

When a JOIN has no condition or an incorrect/missing ON clause.
Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM A, B;  -- No ON condition causes full cross match
How to optimize joins?

Add indexes on join keys.

Minimize the number of rows with WHERE conditions.

Avoid joining unnecessary large tables.

Use only needed columns in SELECT.
